# Ankr.js React Quickstart

This is an example [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project built using [Ankr.js](https://github.com/ankr-network/ankr.js) and [Ankr Advanced APIs](https://ankr.com/advanced-api).

## Run locally

```bash
# to install dependencies
yarn install

# to run the app
yarn dev

# your app will be available at http://localhost:3000
```

The [`utils.ts`](./utils.ts) file contains some helper functions for interacting with the Ankr Advanced APIs.

The [`hooks.ts`](./hooks.ts) file contains some React hooks for those helper functions.
